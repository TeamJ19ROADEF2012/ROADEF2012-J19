This program was developped for the ROADEF/EURO 2012 Challenge.
(More information on the challenge at http://challenge.roadef.org/2012/en/index.php).

The sources corresponding to the final submission are included,
together with some other interesting developments that we eventually
rejected for the final program.

This code was developped by :
    - MichaÃ«l Gabay, PhD student, Laboratoire G-SCOP, Grenoble, France
    - Sofia Zaourar, PhD student, Inria Grenoble, France
Team J19 (Junior, Open-source)

===============================================
Dependencies :
    - Boost (random)
    - STL
    - [Optional] Coin-Cbc (and Coin-Clp), available at http://www.coin-or.org/

All programs can be compiled using make.
make requires the variable CBC_PATH to be set to the Coin-CBC (build) direcory.

If you don't want to use Cbc, you can edit the Makefiles in obj/ and bin/ to
remove Cbc and not compile localIP and localIPReassignment.

make builds machineReassignment and test_neighborhoodReassignment in bin/.

machineReassignment is the executable file and works according to the challenge
specifications, at http://challenge.roadef.org/2012/en/reponse.php.

test_neighborhoodReassignment is a test program for the vector bin packng heuristic.

make doc will generate the documentation in doc/. It requires Doxygen and Dot
(part of Graphviz).
